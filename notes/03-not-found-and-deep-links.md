# Step 3: 'Not Found' and deep links

[^ Notes](./00-notes.md)

Following [Step 1: Setting up Nx,](./01-setting-up-nx.md) app routing has
several issues when hosted using GitHub Pages:

1. The 'Maker' app's generated 'page-2' and 'home' links show non-canonical URLs
   in the browser's address bar
2. There is no '404 Not Found' page
3. Deep linking to /tunefields/make/page-2/ does not work
